                    From Sept. 2023 to Feb 2024, I led a metal detector project with KU's IEEE club. The goal was to
                    make a few metal detecting circuits before the end of February. We were able to
                    complete this project ontime and underbudget. The left image features a schematic from Overton,
                    Moreland - Inside the Metal Detector (2016, Geotech Press), which served as reference for the
                    development of the devices.
